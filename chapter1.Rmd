## A short description and a link to the githuib repository

This is a course that should help me to better work with data analysis in the future. I already *love* __markdown__ ***:)***. I have R knowledge, but I never completed a course in the language, so sometimes I find I am doing very simple things the hardest way imaginable. I hope this course will close these gaps in my knowledge.


The crash course is nice, as I'm not that used to the tidyverse syntax, and was taught to use base R (subsets, slices and such).
I use git for my work, so it's not very convenient for me to start using PATs. But i checked, and it indeed works. I just prefer to do it through gpg.
